Functionality:

index page:
       1. Search
          when click on "Search on UofTExchange", the result will show all the items posted,
          if there is no input in the "Search item" input box, or show items related to the
          input otherwise.

          The search function will requires a server call to pull related result from database.
          As a result, in phase1, after clicking the search button, it will generate the page
          with hardcoded posts array in class.js as a demonstration.

       2. Log In
          The page will jump to login page

       3. My cart
          If user did not log in, the page will jump to login page.
          Otherwise, the page will jump to the user's shopping cart.

       This page is shown when the user clicks "Log in" on the index page.

       2. Sign Up
	  User jumps to create account page.
          Noteï¼šThe newly created user will not be saved in this phase.

	   "Contact Seller" button work in the post of "user1 user1". When the user clicks "Contact Seller",
	   the user should enter a chat box with the corresponding seller. The first "Contact Seller" button works and 
	   shows as an example of what the user should see when they click any "Contact Seller" buttons in Phase 2.
